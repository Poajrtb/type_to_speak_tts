# The number of countries in the world is 228, but why do you only apply for 107 languages?

**Google Translate has a limited number of supported languages, because Google Translate chooses the supported language based on the quality of a particular language and the user's demand. Translation data and technical support for each language are required to support all languages. Given the current technology and resources, Google Translate focuses on the most widely used languages.**

# Only 107 languages are supported
  
  **1.Data Availability: To provide high quality translation requires vast amounts of data on that language. Some languages are not supported because they do not have enough data.**
  
  **2. User Demand: Languages that are not widely used may be a low priority in the translation system.**
  
  **3.Technical Difficulties: Providing high-quality translations for certain language pairs can be very difficult and complex.**
